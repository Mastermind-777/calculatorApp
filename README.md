The Income and Expense Calculator

This application allows you to calculate the amount of monthly and daily expenses. You can also calculate the amount of savings for a month and for a year. 

For the correct calculation, you need to select a month from the list. If you select a different month, the recalculation by the number of days is performed automatically.
